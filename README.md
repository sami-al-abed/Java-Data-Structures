# Java Data Structures
Data Structures I am playing with in Java<br/><br/>
This will be added onto as I play with and try to implement more data structures!<br/>
Feel free to use these for anything but cheating :)<br/><br/>
The following data structures are shown in this repo:<br/>
- Stack<br/>
- Queue<br/>
- Binary tree<br/>
  - Static Integer Binary Tree (not binary search tree)<br/>
  - Traversal Algorithms
